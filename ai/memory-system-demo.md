# Project Memory & Creative Intent System Demo

## 🎯 PURPOSE
This demonstration shows how the project memory system captures creative intent and provides contextual briefings for seamless project continuation after breaks.

## 📋 SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### 1. Project Memory (`ai/project-memory.md`) ✅ CREATED
- Current state & active work streams
- Creative intent capture & design decisions
- Next steps & unfinished business  
- Technical memory & methodological choices
- Project narrative & plot points
- Context refresh triggers & monitoring

### 2. AI Memory Functions (`scripts/ai-memory-functions.R`) ✅ CREATED
- **detect_code_intent()**: Scans R files for creative intent markers
- **generate_project_briefing()**: Creates contextual briefings
- **generate_clarification_prompts()**: AI prompts for unclear intentions
- **update_project_memory()**: Adds new insights to memory file
- **ai_memory_check()**: Main AI function for memory management
- **memory_status()**: Quick status check

### 3. Context Integration (enhanced `scripts/update-copilot-context.R`)
- Loads memory functions automatically
- Provides easy access to memory management
- Integrates with existing context system

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### When You Return to Project:
1. **AI runs**: `ai_memory_check()` or `memory_status()`
2. **You get**:
   - Current project state summary
   - Active work streams & intentions
   - Recent file changes
   - Detected unfinished work
   - Clarifying questions from AI

### When Working (AI Monitors For):
- **Intent Markers**: TODO, FIXME, next step, plan to, should, need to
- **Decision Points**: decision:, choice:, note:, rationale:, because
- **Questions**: consider, think about, maybe, perhaps, might, could
- **Unfinished Work**: incomplete, partial, draft, temp, placeholder
- **Research Intent**: hypothesis, expect, predict, compare, analyze

### AI Prompts You When It Detects:
- "🤔 I noticed some uncertainties in your code..."
- "🚀 I see planned next steps..."
- "⚠️ Detected incomplete work..."
- "💭 I noticed planning language in our conversation..."
- "🎯 I detected decision-making language..."

## 📖 EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

### Scenario: You return after 2 weeks
```r
# In R console:
source("./scripts/update-copilot-context.R")
ai_memory_check()
```

**AI Response:**
```
🧠 AI Memory System Activated

🔄 Recent Activity
Recently modified files:
- 3-ellis-era.R | Modified: 2025-07-28

🎯 Detected Intentions
### 3-ellis-era.R
**FUTURE_WORK:**
- Line 570: Next steps: Link to Income Support episodes via person_oid for outcome analysis
**DECISIONS:**
- Line 271: NOTE: those getting decision=Withdrawn may represent frivolous applications

🤖 AI Detected Unclear Intentions:
🚀 I see planned next steps:
- Line 570: Next steps: Link to Income Support episodes via person_oid for outcome analysis
Should I add these to the project memory with priority levels?

📝 Memory Management Options:
1. Update project memory with current insights
2. Add clarification to specific intention  
3. Generate full project status report
4. Scan all files for undocumented intentions
```

### What's In Your Project Memory:
```markdown
## 🎯 Active Work Stream: ERA Assessment Analysis (Stream B Focus)
**Current Script**: `manipulation/3-ellis-era.R`
**Status**: Creating ANALYSIS2 cohort for longitudinal assessment tracking
**Next**: Link ERA decisions to Income Support episodes for outcome analysis

**Creative Intent Detected**:
- Building comprehensive assessment-to-outcome pipeline
- Focus on Stream B clients (moderate barriers requiring assessment)  
- Compare approved vs. denied client trajectories post-ERA
- Track client evolution through multiple assessments
```

## 🚀 BENEFITS

### For You (Human):
- **Never lose context** when returning to projects
- **Capture fleeting thoughts** automatically through code comments
- **Remember design rationale** for future decisions
- **Track evolution** of ideas and approaches
- **Quick onboarding** after breaks

### For AI:
- **Consistent context** across conversations
- **Understanding of creative process** and intentions
- **Better assistance** based on project history
- **Proactive suggestions** based on detected patterns
- **Continuity** of analytical approach

## 🎮 TRY IT NOW

1. **Check current memory status:**
   ```r
   source("./scripts/ai-memory-functions.R")
   memory_status()
   ```

2. **Get project briefing:**
   ```r
   briefing <- generate_project_briefing()
   cat(paste(briefing, collapse="\n"))
   ```

3. **Scan current file for intentions:**
   ```r
   intents <- detect_code_intent("./manipulation/3-ellis-era.R")
   str(intents)
   ```

4. **Full memory check:**
   ```r
   ai_memory_check()
   ```

## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- **Git integration**: Track commits with creative intent
- **Conversation mining**: Extract decisions from chat history  
- **Visual timeline**: Show project evolution graphically
- **Smart reminders**: Proactive notifications about stale intentions
- **Cross-project memory**: Link related insights across projects
- **Collaborative memory**: Share intent captures with team members

---

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND READY TO USE**

*Try running `ai_memory_check()` next time you start work on this project!*
