# ./ai/README.md

## 🧠 Purpose

This folder provides a minimal, rigorous, and extensible framework for **human–AI collaborative data analysis**, where the human serves as **philosopher–scientist** and the AI functions as a **modal translator and analytic executor**.

## 📂 ./ai/ Core Files

| `ontology-glossary-what.md` | Defines key terms and constructs |
| `epistemology-method-how.md` | Articulates valid methods and inference rules |
| `axiology-values-should.md` | Surfaces ethical commitments and consequences |
| `praxeology-action-who.md` | Clarifies actor roles and responsibilities |
| `semiology-expression-which.md` | Maps how meaning is expressed across dialects |
| `metaphysics-context-where.md` | Situates analysis in time, place, and institution |
| `onboarding_ai.md` | Guides how AI should behave and support the human |

## 🔗 Project Pipeline

`./pipeline.md` outlines the flow of analytic work specific to this project.

## 🔁 Use Case


Use this framework to launch any project that aims to:
- Maintain high interpretability in AI-assisted analytics
- Avoid black-box decisions and silent assumptions
- Structure team handoffs or long-running analytic workflows
- Build cumulative knowledge over iterative modeling cycles

## 🧭 Getting Started

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Initiate `./data-private/raw/research_request.md` to document your research request and its evolution. You will add communication feedback from the client here to trace the evolution of the research request.
3. Customize `./ai/mission.md` to define your project's purpose, axioms, and logic.
4. Tailor `./ai/glossary.md` to your domain.
5. Begin logging analytic moves in `./ai/logbook.md`.
6. Ensure AI agents are prompted using the `./ai/onboarding_ai.md` structure.
