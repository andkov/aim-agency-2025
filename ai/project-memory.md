**Dependencies**: Foundation documentation (✅ Complete)
**Timeline**: Ready to begin implementation

**Technical Objectives**:
1. Implement LinkedIn scraping infrastructure with ethical safeguards
2. Create Twitter/X data collection pipeline with rate limiting
3. Build data validation and cleaning workflows
4. Establish automated compliance monitoring

**Design Decisions Needed**:
- API selection strategy (official APIs vs. scraping tools)
- Data storage format and organization
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Monitoring and alerting systems

## Key Design Decisions

### **Decision: Documentation-First Development Approach** {#doc-first-approach}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: [#1](../../issues/1)
**Context**: Establishing project as pedagogical demonstration requires clear learning pathways
**Options Considered**:
- Code-first approach: Build functionality then document
- Documentation-first: Establish learning framework before implementation
- Parallel approach: Develop both simultaneously

**Decision**: Documentation-first approach for maximum pedagogical value
**Rationale**: 
- Creates clear learning pathway for contributors
- Ensures every technical decision has educational context
- Allows validation of approach before complex implementation
- Supports human-AI collaboration by establishing clear frameworks

**Implementation**: 
- [`docs/`](../docs/) directory with comprehensive learning materials
- [`README.md`](../README.md) as primary entry point
- Cross-reference system linking decisions to implementation

**Learning Value**: Demonstrates how documentation can drive development quality and team alignment
**Future Review**: After Issue #2 completion - validate if documentation guided effective implementation

### **Decision: Three-Phase Architecture** {#three-phase-architecture}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: [#1](../../issues/1), [#2](../../issues/2), [#3](../../issues/3)
**Context**: Need clear progression from data collection to insights for pedagogical clarity
**Options Considered**:
- Monolithic system: Single comprehensive application
- Microservices: Highly distributed components  
- Three-phase pipeline: Collection → Analytics → Reporting

**Decision**: Three-phase pipeline architecture
**Rationale**:
- Each phase represents distinct learning module
- Independent development and testing possible
- Clear separation of concerns for educational value
- Allows contributors to focus on specific expertise areas

**Implementation**: 
- Phase 1: [`docs/architecture.md#phase-1`](../docs/architecture.md#-phase-1-foundation--data-collection)
- Phase 2: [`docs/architecture.md#phase-2`](../docs/architecture.md#-phase-2-analytics-engine)
- Phase 3: [`docs/architecture.md#phase-3`](../docs/architecture.md#-phase-3-reporting--visualization)

**Learning Value**: Shows how to design systems for both functionality and educational progression
**Future Review**: After Phase 1 implementation - assess if boundaries are optimal

### **Decision: Ethics-First Data Collection** {#ethics-first-data}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: [#2](../../issues/2)
**Context**: Social media data collection requires careful ethical framework
**Options Considered**:
- Permissive approach: Collect maximum data, filter later
- Restrictive approach: Minimal collection with strict privacy controls
- Ethics-first approach: Comprehensive guidelines driving implementation

**Decision**: Ethics-first approach with comprehensive guidelines
**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates responsible data science practices
- Creates reusable framework for similar projects
- Builds trust with platform providers and users
- Provides pedagogical value for ethical AI development

**Implementation**: [`docs/ethics-guidelines.md`](../docs/ethics-guidelines.md)
**Learning Value**: Shows how ethical considerations can enhance rather than constrain technical solutions
**Future Review**: During Issue #2 implementation - validate practical applicability

### **Decision: Human-AI Symbiosis Model** {#human-ai-symbiosis}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: All issues
**Context**: Project explicitly demonstrates human-AI collaboration patterns
**Options Considered**:
- AI-autonomous: Minimal human oversight
- Human-led: AI as implementation tool only
- Symbiotic: Explicit collaboration with documented patterns

**Decision**: Symbiotic collaboration with documented patterns
**Rationale**:
- Creates reusable collaboration methodology
- Demonstrates optimal use of both human insight and AI capabilities
- Provides transparent decision-making process
- Generates valuable learning content for AI practitioners

**Implementation**: [`docs/human-ai-patterns.md`](../docs/human-ai-patterns.md)
**Learning Value**: Establishes framework for effective human-AI collaboration in research
**Future Review**: Continuous - assess effectiveness throughout development

## Future Intentions & Open Questions

### **Technical Architecture Evolution** {#architecture-evolution}
**Question**: How will the three-phase architecture scale with real-world usage?
**Context**: Current design optimized for pedagogical clarity
**Considerations**:
- Performance requirements for production social media monitoring
- Integration points with external systems (APIs, databases)
- Deployment and operational concerns

**Next Steps**: Validate architecture during Issue #2 implementation
**Decision Timeline**: After Phase 1 completion

### **Community Engagement Strategy** {#community-engagement}
**Question**: How to maximize learning value for external contributors?
**Context**: Project designed as educational resource
**Considerations**:

**Next Steps**: Monitor contributor engagement during initial issues
**Decision Timeline**: After Issue #3 completion

### **Impact Measurement Framework** {#impact-measurement}
**Question**: How to validate that the system accurately measures AI community impact?
**Context**: Need ground truth for social media sentiment analysis
**Considerations**:
- Manual annotation for validation datasets
- Expert review of thematic categorization
- Long-term tracking methodology validation

**Next Steps**: Design validation framework during Issue #3
**Decision Timeline**: Before Phase 2 implementation
