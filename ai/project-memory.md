## Current State & Intentions

### **Project Pivot Complete - New Direction: Essay Platform** {#pivot-complete}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Context**: Issue #3 implementation - pivoting from LinkedIn scraping to essay writing platform
**Status**: ✅ Pivot implemented
**Rationale**: LinkedIn ToS compliance issues led to strategic pivot focusing on conference theme analysis through essays

**Key Changes**:
- Removed all LinkedIn scraping implementation (5 R scripts)
- Updated project mission from social media monitoring to essay writing
- Maintained pedagogical framework and human-AI collaboration patterns
- Pivoted ethical guidelines from data collection to research ethics
- Updated README.md and core documentation to reflect new purpose

**Learning Impact**: Demonstrates adaptive project management and ethical decision-making in research projects

### **Next Immediate Priorities** {#next-priorities}
**Phase**: Essay Framework Development (Issue #2)
**Dependencies**: Foundation documentation (✅ Complete)
**Timeline**: Ready to begin implementation

**Content Objectives**:
1. Develop essay templates and writing guidelines for AI governance topics
2. Create research methodology framework for analyzing conference themes
3. Build collaborative writing workflows with version control
4. Establish peer review and publication processes

**Design Decisions Needed**:
- Essay structure and formatting standards
- Research source validation processes
- Collaborative editing and review workflows
- Publication and dissemination strategy

## Key Design Decisions

### **Decision: Documentation-First Development Approach** {#doc-first-approach}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: [#1](../../issues/1)
**Context**: Establishing project as pedagogical demonstration requires clear learning pathways
**Options Considered**:
- Code-first approach: Build functionality then document
- Documentation-first: Establish learning framework before implementation
- Parallel approach: Develop both simultaneously

**Decision**: Documentation-first approach for maximum pedagogical value
**Rationale**: 
- Creates clear learning pathway for contributors
- Ensures every technical decision has educational context
- Allows validation of approach before complex implementation
- Supports human-AI collaboration by establishing clear frameworks

**Implementation**: 
- [`docs/`](../docs/) directory with comprehensive learning materials
- [`README.md`](../README.md) as primary entry point
- Cross-reference system linking decisions to implementation

**Learning Value**: Demonstrates how documentation can drive development quality and team alignment
**Future Review**: After Issue #2 completion - validate if documentation guided effective implementation

### **Decision: Three-Phase Architecture** {#three-phase-architecture}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: [#1](../../issues/1), [#2](../../issues/2), [#3](../../issues/3)
**Context**: Need clear progression from research to publication for pedagogical clarity
**Options Considered**:
- Monolithic system: Single comprehensive writing application
- Microservices: Highly distributed components  
- Three-phase pipeline: Research → Writing → Publication

**Decision**: Three-phase pipeline architecture
**Rationale**:
- Each phase represents distinct learning module
- Independent development and testing possible
- Clear separation of concerns for educational value
- Allows contributors to focus on specific expertise areas

**Implementation**: 
- Phase 1: [`docs/architecture.md#phase-1`](../docs/architecture.md#-phase-1-foundation--research-framework)
- Phase 2: [`docs/architecture.md#phase-2`](../docs/architecture.md#-phase-2-content-creation--analysis)
- Phase 3: [`docs/architecture.md#phase-3`](../docs/architecture.md#-phase-3-publication--dissemination)

**Learning Value**: Shows how to design systems for both functionality and educational progression
**Future Review**: After Phase 1 implementation - assess if boundaries are optimal

### **Decision: Ethics-First Research Approach** {#ethics-first-research}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: [#2](../../issues/2), [#3](../../issues/3)
**Context**: Academic research and essay writing requires careful ethical framework
**Options Considered**:
- Permissive approach: Use any available sources, cite minimally
- Restrictive approach: Only use explicitly permitted materials
- Ethics-first approach: Comprehensive guidelines driving research practices

**Decision**: Ethics-first approach with comprehensive research guidelines
**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates responsible scholarship practices
- Creates reusable framework for similar academic projects
- Builds trust with conference organizers and participants
- Provides pedagogical value for ethical research methods

**Implementation**: [`docs/ethics-guidelines.md`](../docs/ethics-guidelines.md)
**Learning Value**: Shows how ethical considerations enhance rather than constrain scholarly work
**Future Review**: During Issue #2 implementation - validate practical applicability

### **Decision: Human-AI Symbiosis Model** {#human-ai-symbiosis}
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Related Issues**: All issues
**Context**: Project explicitly demonstrates human-AI collaboration patterns
**Options Considered**:
- AI-autonomous: Minimal human oversight
- Human-led: AI as implementation tool only
- Symbiotic: Explicit collaboration with documented patterns

**Decision**: Symbiotic collaboration with documented patterns
**Rationale**:
- Creates reusable collaboration methodology
- Demonstrates optimal use of both human insight and AI capabilities
- Provides transparent decision-making process
- Generates valuable learning content for AI practitioners

**Implementation**: [`docs/human-ai-patterns.md`](../docs/human-ai-patterns.md)
**Learning Value**: Establishes framework for effective human-AI collaboration in research
**Future Review**: Continuous - assess effectiveness throughout development

## Future Intentions & Open Questions

### **Technical Architecture Evolution** {#architecture-evolution}
**Question**: How will the three-phase architecture scale with real-world usage?
**Context**: Current design optimized for pedagogical clarity
**Considerations**:
- Performance requirements for production social media monitoring
- Integration points with external systems (APIs, databases)
- Deployment and operational concerns

**Next Steps**: Validate architecture during Issue #2 implementation
**Decision Timeline**: After Phase 1 completion

### **Community Engagement Strategy** {#community-engagement}
**Question**: How to maximize learning value for external contributors?
**Context**: Project designed as educational resource
**Considerations**:
