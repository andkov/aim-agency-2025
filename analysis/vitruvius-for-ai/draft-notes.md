To be human-centered, AI adoption must optimize for human learning. 

I agree, AI is not a tool, but a business solution. However, the environment in which human and AI interact is very much a tool. 


One way to explore the idea is to ask "as apposed to what?" What is the alternative to a human-centered approach?
