# 🎯 AIM Agency 2025 Impact Monitoring System

> **An open-source, pedagogical demonstration** of monitoring and analyzing real-world impact of AI community events through automated social media tracking, sentiment analysis, and longitudinal reporting.

## **🎓 Project Vision**

This project tracks the impact of the "Agency - Summer 2025: Agentic Public Infrastructure" event (July 29, 2025, Edmonton, AB) on Alberta's AI ecosystem, particularly within government and public service sectors. 

**More importantly**, it serves as a **living tutorial** demonstrating human-AI collaboration patterns, ethical data collection, reproducible analytics, and open science practices.

## **🚀 Quick Start for Learners**
