# LinkedIn Data Collection Strategy
## Agency Summer 2025 Event Impact Monitoring

### Overview

This document outlines our approach for collecting LinkedIn data related to the "Agency - Summer 2025: Agentic Public Infrastructure" event (July 29, 2025) from specific profiles who were likely participants or influencers.

### Target Profiles

We're focusing on four specific LinkedIn profiles:

1. **mykodev** - `https://www.linkedin.com/in/mykodev/`
2. **janak-alford** - `https://www.linkedin.com/in/janak-alford/`
3. **jean-paullalonde** - `https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-paullalonde/`
4. **julieish** - `https://www.linkedin.com/in/julieish/`

### Data Collection Goals

**Primary Objectives:**
- Identify key people who post about the event
- Track replies and engagement patterns
- Measure popularity of ideas through engagement metrics
- Generate hashtag clouds associated with the event

**Data Points to Collect:**
- Post content and timestamps
- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- Hashtags and mentions
- Profile information (anonymized)
- Network connections (where publicly visible)

### Technical Implementation

#### Approach: Direct Web Scraping (No API)

**Tools:**
- `RSelenium` for browser automation
- `rvest` for HTML parsing
- `httr2` for HTTP requests
- Headless Firefox with stealth configuration

**Process:**
1. Setup stealth browser with realistic headers
2. Navigate to each profile's activity page
3. Scroll to load recent posts
4. Extract post content, metadata, and engagement
5. Filter for event-relevant content
6. Apply rate limiting and ethical safeguards

#### File Structure

```
scripts/data-collection/
├── linkedin-profile-scraper.R      # Main scraping logic
├── linkedin-utils.R                # Utility functions
├── linkedin-config.R               # Configuration settings
├── run-linkedin-scraper.R          # Execution script
└── demo-linkedin-scraper.R         # Demo/testing script
```

### Ethical Framework

#### Privacy Protection
- **Public Content Only**: Only scrape publicly visible posts
- **Anonymization**: Remove personal identifiers before saving
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only event-relevant information
- **Secure Storage**: Store in `data-private/` (not committed to git)

#### Platform Respect
- **Rate Limiting**: 3-8 second delays between requests
- **Robots.txt**: Check and respect platform guidelines
- **Terms Compliance**: Academic/research use only
- **Attribution**: Proper citation of data sources

#### Legal Considerations
- **Fair Use**: Research and educational purposes
- **No Commercial Use**: Academic research only
- **Transparency**: Document methodology publicly
- **Right to Privacy**: Respect individual privacy expectations

### Expected Challenges

#### Technical Obstacles
- **Authentication Walls**: Many LinkedIn profiles require login
- **Bot Detection**: Sophisticated anti-scraping measures
- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript-heavy pages requiring browser automation
- **Rate Limiting**: Platform-imposed request limitations

#### Data Quality Issues
- **Incomplete Coverage**: May miss private or restricted content
- **Temporal Accuracy**: LinkedIn uses relative timestamps ("2 hours ago")
- **Engagement Visibility**: Some metrics may not be publicly available
- **Content Evolution**: Posts may be edited or deleted

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Testing & Validation
1. **Demo Script**: Test approach on single profile
2. **Accessibility Check**: Verify public content availability
3. **Legal Review**: Confirm compliance with platform terms
4. **Technical Validation**: Test browser automation setup

#### Phase 2: Limited Deployment
1. **Single Profile**: Full scraping of one profile for validation
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error recovery
3. **Data Pipeline**: Test full collection to analysis workflow
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate data completeness and accuracy

#### Phase 3: Full Implementation
1. **All Profiles**: Scrape all four target profiles
2. **Event Focus**: Filter for July 29, 2025 activity
3. **Analysis Pipeline**: Generate insights and visualizations
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive methodology documentation

### Alternative Strategies

If direct LinkedIn scraping proves unfeasible:

#### Google Search Proxy
- Search for LinkedIn posts via Google
- Scrape Google results for LinkedIn URLs
- Attempt targeted scraping of specific posts

#### Manual Content Curation
- Manually identify relevant LinkedIn posts
- Create targeted list of specific post URLs
- Focused scraping of pre-identified content

#### Cross-Platform Analysis
- Twitter/X data collection (potentially easier)
- Reddit discussions about the event
- News coverage mentioning LinkedIn activity
- Direct participant interviews

### Success Metrics

#### Technical Success
- Successfully access and scrape 70%+ of target profiles
- Extract meaningful post content from event timeframe
- Collect engagement metrics for analysis
- Generate hashtag and mention networks

#### Research Value
- Identify key influencers and conversation patterns
- Track idea propagation and engagement evolution
- Create reusable methodology for similar events
- Document human-AI collaboration patterns in research

### Risk Mitigation

#### Platform Relations
- Minimal requests with respectful rate limiting
- Focus on clearly public content only
- Academic research context and attribution
- Transparent methodology documentation

#### Legal Protection
- Research and educational use only
- Data anonymization and privacy protection
- Compliance with fair use principles
- Regular legal and ethical review

#### Technical Resilience
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Multiple fallback strategies
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Manual intervention capabilities

### Expected Outputs

#### Raw Data
- `data-private/raw/linkedin_profiles_YYYYMMDD.rds`
- Individual profile data with full metadata
- Timestamped collection logs

#### Processed Data  
- `data-private/derived/linkedin_profiles_anonymized_YYYYMMDD.rds`
- Anonymized profiles with personal identifiers removed
- Event-relevant posts filtered and cleaned

#### Analysis Results
- Network graphs of mentions and hashtags
- Engagement trend analysis
- Influence metrics and key participant identification
- Hashtag cloud visualizations

#### Documentation
- Methodology documentation with lessons learned
- Ethical framework validation
- Technical implementation guide
- Recommendations for future similar projects
